# PhysicsJSGame

An application I put together whilst I was playing around with PhysicsJS: http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/

It's a hamster on a skateboard -- go figure!! In its current state it does nothing more than give a quick push and roll off the screen, but it allowed plenty of opportunity to try out different scenarios and get an idea of how best to create a body and how t constrain it.

I have a Master degree in Mechanical Engineering and as part of my final project I produced a simulation using an accurate model of all the parts so as part of the experimentation I had tried assembling the hamster as several bodies in order to get a more accurate representation. My intention with the car was to use it to predict tyre behaviour, but I soon realised this level of accuracy wasn't required for a HTML5 game so I simplified it to a head and a body, fixed together and concentrated on its movement as a whole.

##Installation
- To install the application first clone the repository. 
- Then open a CLI inside the directory you have cloned it to.
- Install the Node modules (```npm install```).
- Install the Bower packages (```bower install```)
- Using a Grunt task, run the Node server to open the application in your browser. (```grunt serve```).
